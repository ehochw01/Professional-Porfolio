# Professional-Porfolio

Description:

Here is a web page that contains my professional portfolio. It is meant to have a bio of me, some links to some projects I've done, and my contant info. It is currently a work in progress as I need to add more projects to it as I create them. So far I have only added one project image which is a music project, not a coding project.

The nav header has links that will bring the user to different sections of the page. Other links will open other websites in a new tab. 

I underestimated how time this would time me since CSS is not intuitive to me. Particularly, the positioning of elements took me a lot of time. I was not able to implement a responsive layout that I was happy with, or make the page look as good as I wanted to. It will be a future goal to fix these things as I learn more in my bootcamp, and add projects to my portfolio.
